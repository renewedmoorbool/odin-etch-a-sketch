# odin-etch-a-sketch
A grid you can colour, to sketch the things you prefer in pixel art form! 
To open and view the project you can download it and open the index.html 
(Beware, all the files must be contained in the same folder) or you can see
the live version at: https://renewedmoorbool.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/ 

NOTE: The project has reached its end, the code has to be reviewed yet. 
I am aware that I have not followed cleanliness practices nor implemented 
modularity, I just focused on the final product. Right now my goal was to show that I 
learnt DOM Manipulation Skills.  

Refactoring of the code will be performed soon. 

Cordial Greetings,
